      ======================================
        In order to establish dominance amongst
        his friends, Chef has decided that he will
        only walk in large steps of length exactly
        K feet. However, this has presented many
        problems in Chefâ€™s life because there are
        certain distances that he cannot traverse.
        Eg. If his step length is 5 feet, he cannot
        travel a distance of 12 feet. Chef has a
        strict travel plan that he follows on most
        days, but now he is worried that some of
        those distances may become impossible to
        travel. Given N distances, tell Chef
        which ones he cannot travel.
