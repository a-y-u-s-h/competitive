      ======================================
        Chef has decided to join a Gym in
        ChefLand and if possible, also hire a
        personal trainer at the gym. The
        monthly cost of the gym is X and personal
        training will cost him an additional Y
        per month. Chef's total budget per month
        is only Z.

        1 if Chef can only join the gym,
        2 if he can also have a personal trainer, and
        0 if he can't even join the gym.

        Note that if Chef wants to hire a personal
        trainer, he must join the gym â€” he cannot
        hire the trainer without joining the gym.
