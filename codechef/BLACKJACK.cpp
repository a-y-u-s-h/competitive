        Chef is playing a variant of Blackjack,
        where 3 numbers are drawn and each
        number lies between 1 and 10 (with both
        1 and 10 inclusive). Chef wins the game
        when the sum of these 3 numbers is exactly 21.

        Given the first two numbers A and B, that
        have been drawn by Chef, what should be 3-rd
        number that should be drawn by the Chef in
        order to win the game?

        Note that it is possible that Chef cannot win
        the game, no matter what is the 3-rd number.
        In such cases, report âˆ’1 as the answer.
