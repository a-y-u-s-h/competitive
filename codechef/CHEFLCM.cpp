        Chef wants to hire a new assistant.
        He published an advertisement regarding
        that in a newspaper. After seeing the
        advertisement, many candidates have
        applied for the job. Now chef wants
        to shortlist people for the interviews,
        so he gave all of them one problem which
        they must solve in order to get shortlisted.

        The problem was : For a given positive
        integer N, what is the maximum sum of
        distinct numbers such that the Least
        Common Multiple of all these numbers is N.

        Your friend Rupsa also applied for the
        job, but was unable to solve this
        problem and hence you've decided
        to help her out by writing a code
        for solving this problem.
