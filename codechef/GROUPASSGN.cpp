        There are 2N students in class, with
        distinct roll numbers randing from
        1 to 2N. Chef's roll number is X.

        The professor decided to create N groups
        of 2 students each. The groups were
        created as follows: the first group
        consists of roll numbers 1 and 2N, the
        second group of roll numbers 2 and 2Nâˆ’1,
        and so on, with the final group consisting
        of roll numbers N and N+1.

        Find the roll number of Chef's partner.
