      ======================================
        Alice has learnt factorization recently.
        Bob doesn't think she has learnt it
        properly and hence he has decided to
        quiz her. Bob gives Alice a very large
        number and asks her to find out the
        number of factors of that number. To
        make it a little easier for her, he
        represents the number as a product of
        N numbers. Alice is frightened of big
        numbers and hence is asking you for
        help. Your task is simple. Given N
        numbers, you need to tell the number
        of distinct factors of the product
        of these N numbers.
