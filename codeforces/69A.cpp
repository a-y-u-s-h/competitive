    ======================================
      A guy named Vasya attends the final
      grade of a high school. One day Vasya
      decided to watch a match of his favorite
      hockey team. And, as the boy loves
      hockey very much, even more than physics,
      he forgot to do the homework. Specifically,
      he forgot to complete his physics tasks.
      Next day the teacher got very angry at
      Vasya and decided to teach him a lesson.

      He gave the lazy student a seemingly
      easy task: You are given an idle body
      in space and the forces that affect it.
      The body can be considered as a material
      point with coordinates (0; 0; 0). Vasya
      had only to answer whether it is in
      equilibrium. "Piece of cake" â€” thought
      Vasya, we need only to check if the
      sum of all vectors is equal to 0. So,
      Vasya began to solve the problem. But
      later it turned out that there can be
      lots and lots of these forces, and
      Vasya can not cope without your help.

      Help him. Write a program that
      determines whether a body is idle
      or is moving by the given
      vectors of forces.
